# Citations
This is a bit of code that I use for generating quick citations to overlay
on figures that I output in R. It contains a few R scripts that I've kept
for legacy purposes, but the primary script (that I will often source in
other projects) is the 
[Citation Function.R](https://github.com/HunterRatliff1/Citations/blob/master/Citation%20Function.R)
file. 

At some point in the future I plan to go back and release this as a package 
on CRAN, but for the time being it will remain as a messy repo on Githib. 
I appologize if it's a bit confusing right now, but for the most part you
can feel free to ingore this reop!
